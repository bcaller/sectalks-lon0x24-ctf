# Zeppelin

Need to do some data science from home so I opened my notebook server to the world.
There are no flags on the machine, so why not?

The container has no added vulnerability.

Enjoy the RCEaaS.


# Shiro's Hindenburger

The only change is that I turned on Shiro-authentication and set non-default passwords, so no more unauthenticated RCE, right?

This is a problem commonly seen on Zeppelin instances deployed in the wild. This time the flag is on the machine.

This is hard, so is worth 6000 points.
