Hangul or Hangeul is the alphabet (or alphabetic syllabary) used for the Korean language.

It was made by Sejong the Great, the 4th King of the Joseon Dynasty in 1443, and it is still used. When Hangeul was spreading, King Sejong published Hunminjeong'eum Haeryebon which was chosen as the 'Memory of the World' by UNESCO in 1997. In this book, the design ideas of Hangeul and information about its use were written down in detail.

The book Hunminjeong'eum Haeryebon states the two design ideas of Hangeul. The first one is that the consonants of Hangeul look like vocal organs. The second one is that the vowels of Hangeul are based on Cheonji'in. Cheonji'in refers to the three elements of philosophy which are sky, earth and human. Because of these ideas, Hangeul is well known for being easy to learn.

Although it was only used by the lower classes at first, Hangeul became the official writing script of Korea in the late 19th century. Today it is the most used writing system of both North Korea and South Korea. North Korea abolished the use of Hanja, and today North Koreans write only in Hangeul. In South Korea, people write mostly in Hangeul, but sometimes Hanja is still used.
